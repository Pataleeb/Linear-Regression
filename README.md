# Linear-Regression
Here we assume that the percentage of body fat using Brozekâ€™s equation (brozek, the first column) as the response variable, and the other 17 variables as potential predictors. We will use several different statistical methods to fit this dataset in the problem of predicting brozek using the other 17 potential predictors.
